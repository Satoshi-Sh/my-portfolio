        <h3>Why Tech?</h3>
        <p>Hello, my name is Satoshi. I'm originally from Japan. Since I immigrated to Canada,
          I had a various work from kitchens to offices.
        </p>
        <p>  
          At my last work, I was in a department which took care of data entry for the business partners.
          It needs a lot of typing and attention to details. One mistakes gives a lot of damages to the partner business and my company would
          lose the trust of us. I did my best to keep up the requests but at some point, I feel some of tasks can be automated with a programming language.
          At this point, I had never touched that point but I started learning Python on my free time with online learning materials especially date related field.
        </p>
        <p>
           I realized that I liked learning those stuff and programming to realize my idea, so decided to leave the job and learn full time.
           Along the way, I learned a lot about data analysis and data science. Especially, I enjoyed doing data extraction from website.
           I also knew I could host website with Python(Django). I got more interested in Web Development. I tried various technologies to know the concept of webdevelopment.
           Flask, PHP, React, Express, and so on through Online learning materials and on my own projects. 
        </p>
        <p>
           I believe it's time for me to get into the tech industry as a webdeveloper. I made this website as a portofolio. Hope you enjoyed reading this. 
        </p>
